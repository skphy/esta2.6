Gaussian Process
****************

GPR: Gaussian Process Regression
--------------------------------

GPR is an non-linear regession algorirm based on gaussian processes. For details see the classic book of `Rasmussen et al.`_ and the `gaussianprocess website`_.


Linear fitting 
**************

Linear Regression
-----------------

A linear regression model just finds a linear relation between descriptors and the output. For more details see the book of Kevin Murphy or some other standard text 
books on machine learning.


More information of these implementations, specifically GPR will be added latter.
